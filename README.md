# ICPC 2023 Online Spring Challenge powered by Huawei
This repository contains the solution for the ICPC 2023 Online Spring Challenge powered by Huawei, which took place from April 13, 2023, to April 27, 2023.


In addition to the solution, this repository also serves as a platform to share my experiences and learning throughout the challenge. I encountered various obstacles and learned valuable lessons while exploring different eviction algorithms, their advantages and drawbacks, and experimenting with multiple approaches to achieve the best possible results. The process of trial and error provided me with a deeper understanding of multi-tenant database environments and the importance of efficient buffer management.

I hope that sharing my experiences and insights will be helpful to others who are interested in this problem or are facing similar challenges in their own projects.
## Problem: Buffer Sharing in Multi-Tenant Database Environment
The challenge revolves around optimizing sharing and isolation of database buffers in a multi-tenant database environment. The goal is to find the best eviction algorithm to manage the limited buffer resources efficiently.

* Special thanks to my wife Laura who not only managed to survive two weeks of hearing about buffer management algorithms but also made tremendous efforts to allow me to have the time to focus on the challenge. She helped create an environment where my only concern was solving the problem at hand.
* Thanks to Huawei and the ICPC Foundation for organizing the ICPC 2023 Online Spring Challenge.
* Special thanks to Huawei 2012 Labs and Huawei Cloud Computing for preparing the problem.
